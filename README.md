# Net-Banking-App

This project aims to simulate a **Net Banking / UPI application**. I am creating this application to strengthen my understanding of **Java concepts** and become familiar with real-world application development using Java.

## 🎯 Objectives

The application will serve as a simulation of a typical net banking experience, allowing users to:

- 🔐 **Login** with credentials
- 💰 **Check account balance**
- 📜 **View transaction history**
- 💸 **Make transactions**

## 🧠 Learning Goals

Through building this project, I aim to:

- Practice **OOPs (Object-Oriented Programming)** principles
- Understand how to structure **Java projects**
- Work with **data structures** to manage transactions and users
- Simulate real-world banking functionality in a **console-based Java application**
